# Image Captioning, OCR, and TTS Web App

This project is a Flask-based web application that combines image captioning, optical character recognition (OCR), and text-to-speech (TTS) functionalities. 


## Features
- **Image Captioning**: Generates captions for images using BLIP.
- **OCR**: Extracts text from images using EasyOCR.
- **TTS**: Converts text to speech using Silero TTS models.
- **Interactive UI**: Hover-based interactions with a modern, responsive design.

## Notes
- Models are downloaded on first run (requires internet).
- The app runs on CPU by default; modify model files for GPU support if needed.
- Temporary files are saved in static/.
